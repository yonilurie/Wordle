# New York Times Wordle Clone
## [Deployed Application](https://nyt-wordle-clone.netlify.app/)
This is a clone of the New York Times Wordle game.

Users have 6 guesses to guess a 5 letter word. As they guess they will be provided with feedback on whether or not their guesses are accurate.
* A green letter on a guessed word means the letter is in the correct place.
* A gold letter means that the guessed letter is in the word, but not in that location.
* A grey letter means that the letter is not present in the word at all.
